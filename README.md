# Forest Fire Classification
  
In the Forest Fire Classification project, we aim to develop a robust model using TensorFlow framework that accurately identifies instances of forest fires from images. Leveraging pre-trained models like ResNet-50, VGG16 (transfer learning) alongside Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) facilitates feature extraction and classification processes efficiently. The project involves collecting a diverse dataset of forest fire images along with non-fire images for training and evaluation purposes. <br>

Initially, we preprocess the dataset by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting images to enhance model generalization. We then split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure unbiased evaluation. Employing transfer learning, we fine-tune ResNet-50 and VGG16 architectures on the dataset, adapting the pre-trained models' weights to classify forest fire images effectively.

During training, we employ techniques like learning rate scheduling, early stopping, and model checkpoints to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting. Additionally, we utilize techniques such as data augmentation to expand the dataset and improve model robustness. Extensive hyperparameter tuning and model optimization are performed to achieve the desired accuracy threshold of over 90%. <br>

Post-training, rigorous evaluation is conducted on the testing set to assess the model's performance in real-world scenarios. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed to gauge the model's effectiveness in detecting forest fires accurately. Finally, the model is deployed in production environments where it can actively monitor and identify forest fire occurrences, aiding in timely interventions and mitigating potential disasters. <br>
